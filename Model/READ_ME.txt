in the appendices.

2. A folder with the model. It contains the agent framework (agent_particle.py), the model (Bomb_model_v1) and
a raster file (bomb.txt).



RUNNING THE MODEL

In order to run the model it is necesssary to first run the "agent_particle.py" file and subsequently the "Bomb_model_v1"
file. The section 2.1 of the code allows the user to modify the model parameters: height and the number of bacteria 
particles.
